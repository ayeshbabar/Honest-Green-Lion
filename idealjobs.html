          <h3>Comparing Ayesha's & Esther's Ideal Jobs & Career Plans</h3>
          <p>
            Ayesha and Esther will both have to work in teams in their
            professional life. They both must have IT qualifications and be
            flexible. However, Esther’s job is based in the office, while
            Ayesha’s is not. Esther’s and Ayesha’s ideal jobs are significantly
            different from each other. Ayesha’s career plan will take more than
            5 years to achieve, while Esther’s will take less than 5 years.
            Ayesha will need to complete more than one degree to reach her
            target, while Esther will need a Bachelor’s degree in Information
            Technology. Ayesha’s ideal job requires her to be creative, while
            Esther’s does not.
          </p>
          <h3>Comparing Ayesha’s and Kur’s Jobs and Career Plans</h3>
          <p>
            There are four similarities and three differences between Ayesha’s
            and Kur’s ideal jobs. Both Ayesha and Kur will be required to work
            in teams and work with clients. Both must have some sort of IT
            qualification, be flexible, and have experience in fast-moving and
            agile environments. However, Kur’s ideal job is based in the office
            while Ayesha’s has flexible work hours and can be done from home.
            Ayesha’s job does not require her to work with different industries,
            while Kur’s job does. As for the career plans, there is no
            similarity between Ayesha’s and Kur’s career plans. Ayesha’s plan
            will take her more than five years to complete and requires more
            than just the Information Technology degree, while Kur’s plan will
            take less than five years to complete and require just the
            Information Technology degree.
