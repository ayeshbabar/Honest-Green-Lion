                                complete tasks. Another similarity would be that

                                from University. A final similarity is that both

                                to be able to apply for their Ideal Jobs. A
                                final similarity between their career plans is
                                that; both their tasks are going to take a few
                                years to complete their career plans. Some
                                differences between Ayesha’s and Esther’s career
                                plans are that; after Ayesha obtains her
                                Bachelor In Information Technology – she needs
                                to obtain the bachelor’s degree in arts (digital
                                experience and interaction) to be able to meet

                                plans is that Ayesha’s career plan – is probably
                                going to take 10-12 years to complete (due to
                                bachelor’s degree of Information Technology and
                                the bachelor’s degree in arts (digital

                                Esther’s career plan will take at least 3 years
                                to complete (due to only needing the bachelor’s
                                degree of Information Technology).

                                environments. Another similarity between the 2

                                skills. Another similarity between the 2 jobs is

                                different roles. Another difference would be
                                that Kur’s Ideal job is Office – based, while in
                                Ayesha’s Ideal job – the applicant can work at

                                clients. A final difference is that Kur’s Ideal
                                job – the applicant works with a range of
                                different companies in different industries,
                                while Ayesha’s does not.
