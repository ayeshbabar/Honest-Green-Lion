            From the table above, it can be observed that although Matthew’s and
            Moustafa’s ideal jobs have the same requirements, they are not the
            same. Ayesha’s ideal job is very different to the rest of the teams
            ideal jobs. Her jobs requirements are very different. Another thing
            that can be observed is that all the members’ ideal jobs require
            them to work in teams, have an IT qualification, and be flexible.
            So, it is clear that all jobs related to IT require the applicants
            to work in teams, and hence, HGL members will have to learn how to
            do that well. They have learned much from this experience and wish
            to apply what they learned in the future, in the case of landing
            their ideal jobs.

            <img

              height="317"
              alt="table comparing ideal jobs"
            /><br />From the table above, we can observe that Ayesha’s career
            plan will take the longest, i.e. more than five years to complete,
            while the rest of the members’ plans will take less than five years.
            Ayesha’s and Matthew’s plans requires them to complete more than
            just the bachelors of Information Technology degree, while the rest
            of the members will just need that degree to achieve their goals.
            Esther, Kur and Moustafa’s plans are very similar to each other, as
            can be seen from the table above.
