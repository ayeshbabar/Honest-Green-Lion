              <h2>Ayesha (s3885706)</h2>
              <p>
                Ayesha is a Muslim girl, born in Pakistan. She moved to
                Australia when she was six years old, and moved back to Pakistan
                after eight-nine years. She owns dual nationalities; Australian
                and Pakistani. Ayesha now lives with her parents, grandparents
                (from her father’s side), a younger sister, who is currently
                doing the same course with her, and a younger brother. She can
                fluently speak English and Urdu, and knows a little bit of
                Arabic and Korean too. She has completed her ‘A’ Levels in
                engineering, and two subjects from Curtin University; ‘Academic
                and Professional Communications’ and ‘Culture to Cultures’.
                Ayesha enjoys reading books from time to time, and wishes to own
                a Persian kitten in the future. Her interest in It began last
                year, when she began to explore more about what her father does
                for a living. Her father insisted that she complete a HTML & CSS
                course from LinkedIn Learning, which helped in increasing her
                interest in this field. “Writing code is actually better than I
                thought”, she thought. Ayesha’s goal is to become a UX/UI
                designer, and the reason for her enrollment in this degree is
                her interest in IT and her father’s words: “Designers should
                have a little background knowledge of IT as well. That will help
                them to create implementable designs and hence, fewer of their
                designs will be rejected by the developer, making the web
                development process easier and faster.”

              <h2>Esther (s3880950)</h2>
              <p>
                Esther is a vibrant and lively person. She comes from a mixed
                background; her father is Kenyan and her mother, Australian.
                Esther speaks English but is aiming to learn the Japanese
                language soon. She owns two huskies, Bear and Lily, and a cat
                called Felix. Esther was studying to earn a degree in Bachelor
                of Interior Architecture, but wasn’t able to complete it, and
                after taking a gap year, developed an interest in criminology
                and hence began to pursue a degree in that field. Her wish is to
                join AFP’s cybercrime unit in the future, However, she is
                impartial to any career involving cyber security. She recently
                discovered that a little of her interest lays in the field of IT
                as well, which is why she is taking this unit, Information to
                IT, as her steps towards a Bachelor’s degree in Information
                Technology. She believes that having an IT degree is of benefit
                to understanding the ever-changing technological universe.
                Another reason that has influenced her decision to commit to an
                IT degree was her mother, as she works in IT and has nothing but
                praise for her career.

              <h2>Kur (s3515127)</h2>
              <p>
                Kur is a reliable person and has an altruistic personality. He
                comes from South Sudan, his native language being Thuɔŋjäŋ, more
                commonly known as Dinka, but he speaks Arabic and English too.
                Kur claims that he has no previous knowledge in Information
                Technology and neither does he have any higher education
                degrees. He has had an interest in IT for quite some time now,
                and he says that he is interested in all of its branches.
                Understanding the importance and the various uses of IT is what
                sparked his interest, and he is looking forward to gain more
                insights into this field with the help of this subject. His
                current education level is equivalent to Year 10, and he plans
                on getting a degree in Bachelor of Information technology, and
                successfully securing a position in the field. An interesting
                fact about Kur is that he has experience in various farming
                industries, such as agriculture, horticulture, and viticulture,
                and he used to own a farm with sheep, goats, pigs, cows, &
                poultry, and grow fodder, fruit and vegetables as a hobby.

              <h2>Matthew (s3020028)</h2>
              <p>
                Matthew is a very creative and practical person. He is the
                oldest member on the team. Matthew enjoyed a privileged
                childhood, in a small Victorian country town, Mildura. His
                parents were horticulturists, both with a Croatian background.
                Although both his parents spoke Croatian, Matthew was unable to
                learn the language apart from a few swear words that he used
                with his cousins! His family had a vineyard, that produced a
                variety of grapes, and Matthew really enjoyed working on the
                property along with his siblings. He completed all his primary
                and secondary education in Mildura, attaining his VCE in 2001.
                He then moved to Melbourne, where he earned a Diploma in
                Telecommunications from RMIT. Matthew has completed multiple
                online IT training courses and has currently started a Degree in
                IT. He is very interested in the fact that enabled hardware can
                be connected in a way to provide instant communication to
                others. “IT has been embedded into me from an early age by my
                Grandfather who worked with computers and telecommunications
                during his career” he says. Ever since then, he has been
                researching the how, why, what, where, and when about IT. Over
                the last two decades, he has been passionate about building
                Computer systems, Maintaining Hardware, System Administration,
                Networking and encapsulating all these elements into home and
                work networks, hosting game servers and providing advice for
                family and friends. Apart from his interest in IT, Matthew likes
                playing the drums. He has taken part in miscellaneous bands that
                have toured across Australia, releasing a number of albums onto
                the Interwebs and also thought the drums to high-school
                students.

              <h2>Moustafa (s3887033)</h2>
              <p>
                Moustafa, the youngest member on the team, is a 17-year-old,
                Muslim boy, born and raised in Australia by Iraqi parents. He
                comes from an Arab tribe called “Taghlib”, which is a branch of
                the “Rabiah” tribe. His people were a people of disgrace who
                would die in battle over camels until Allah (SWT) honored them
                with Islam. Growing up in an Australian-Iraqi environment,
                Moustafa learnt how to speak the Arabic and English language. He
                graduated from high-school in September, last year, but decided
                not to attend the HSC exams as he had different plans in mind
                for his career. He wanted to pursue a career in the vast field
                of IT, hence undertaking some online units to do so. Moustafa is
                a passionate young man, his culture being of much importance to
                him. He enjoys reading books and going out with friends.
                Moustafa’s interest in It began in 2017. Growing up, he played a
                lot of video games including CSGO, so when Intel held their
                first Extreme Masters in Sydney, he made sure to attend with his
                friends. There, he enjoyed all the PC Builds, developing
                interest in them. He did some research and eventually built his
                own PC, watching YouTube Videos. Since then, he’s always been
                interested in reading about new technological discoveries. He
                even took some IT electives in high-school, which he thoroughly
                enjoyed. Fun fact about Moustafa’s tribe: The royal family of
                Saudi Arabia “Al Saud” and the royal family of Kuwait “Al Sabah”
                are also from the same tribe as Moustafa, and yet they won’t
                give his tribe any oil money.

          <h2>Group Process</h2>
          <p>
            Overall, Honest Green Lion was able to work well together, without
            facing much difficulties, problems, and conflicts, etc. However, in
            the previous assignment, HGL felt the need to improve in some
            aspects, which includes, reading the specification thoroughly,
            before actually starting to work on the assignment. So, this time
            around, HGL made sure to read the specifications properly! Hopefully
            we have not missed anything this time! Another aspect that needs
            improving is the communication between the group members and HGL is
            working to improve this, by sending constant reminders to each
            other, to remind them of the meeting times. One more thing HGL will
            improve on is the pdf submission. Last time, we made it on the last
            day so it was a bit rushed and not properly formatted. This time we
            will make it beforehand. The rest of the processes will remain the
            same as A2.

          <h4>Ayesha's Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            For A2, we were told that the pdf seemed rushed (I made it last
            time), so this time I decided to start working on the pdf report
            before-hand so that I have the time to format it and match the font
            to the website, and keep the font sizes and colours consistent
            throughout the document. From past experiences, I learned that
            starting work on the assignment on time and making sure to read the
            specifications and go through it thoroughly is very important, so I
            made sure to that and hence, working on this assignment was a little
            less hectic. This assignment went a lot smoother for me compared to
            last time, however, I cannot be sure that it was the same for the
            other members. I can only hope that it was. What could and should
            have improved is the group communication. I was hoping that it would
            get better but instead it ended up becoming worse. It is
            understandable that some members had some problems and constraints
            due to which communication was a problem, but if I’m being
            completely honest, not being able to get your message along, or not
            getting a response from someone can make working in a group very
            tough. Despite the trouble that our group faced, we were able to
            work it out and we managed to finish the assignment! We did our best
            and I hope we get good marks this time as well!

          <h4>Moustafa's Reflection</h4>
          <p>At the Beginning of A2 our team dealt with a lot of arrivals and
            leaves, we've had 3 members leave and 1 member join. At first we had
            to plan and assign the tasks to the four of us then when a fifth 
            member joined and made our tasks easy upon us. Similar thing
            happened with A3, one of our members did not show any activity or
            communication for the first week and a bit, so our team planned our
            tasks around the fourth us again then eventually our fifth member
            began showing activity and informed us on what happened. Working
            with Honest Green Team was a blessing, everyone was respectful to
            each other and no one complained, when someone needed help we
            would all assist them. Our Communication can be improved though
            we need to understand that everyone lives in different time zones
            and have work, families, gym, etc. Other then that we completed
            and achieved what was expected in our assignment as a team.
