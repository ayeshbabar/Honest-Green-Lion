          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h4>Topic</h4>
          <p>
            AutomobileShare is the project idea of Honest Green Lion.
            AutomobileShare is a web-based service that allows car owners to
            list their vehicles with availability for individuals to hire from a
            few hours to days or weeks. Individuals can search for car brands,
            availability and location. This is intended to give individuals an
            efficient experience. There are countless websites from car rentals
            to share rides such as Kayak, and Autorentals.com, etc (Perkins
            2021), however Honest Green Lion looked at this idea and thought why
            not allow people to make money off their own vehicles. Users will be
            able to choose a location to pick up the vehicle, have a timeframe
            the vehicle is available, and set prices depending on what time of
            the day it is or what day of the week. AutomobileShare is a
            different concept to the traditional rental of a car. Members of
            this service have total control over every aspect of this
            service.<br />
            Members will be able to sign up to this service via a website or
            mobile app. Members will need to provide personal data such as Name,
            Date of Birth, licence type, state of Issue, any state, territory or
            federal convictions (such as drink driving, loss of licence
            offences) (FTC.gov 2012). This data will then be vetted to confirm
            the member is suitable for this service at this current time. Users
            of this service will also need to bear in mind if they are involved
            in an accident an excess of the members vehicle will need to be
            paid, this will ensure the members who offer their car to this
            service aren't out of pocket and users cannot treat this service as
            a free for all.
          </p>
          <h4>Motivation</h4>
          <p>
            Could your car make you money? Does your vehicle just sit in the
            garage? Do you worry about upcoming expenses for your vehicle? What
            if there was a way you could make your vehicle work for you.
            AutomobileShare may be the answer to your problems. AutomobileShare
            is a car sharing platform that will allow you to lease out your
            vehicle when it is not in use. Think of Airbnb but for vehicles. You
            will be able to set dates for your vehicle’s availability, set
            prices, set age limits and even approve or disapprove users from
            your vehicle. You will be 100% in control.
          </p>
          <h4>Landscape</h4>
          <p>
            A quick internet search for “Car for hire” you will come across
            multiple websites that have outdated and complicated user
            interferences and experiences. For example, carjet.com with its
            messy interference, asks the users to complete multiple actions in
            one given time. This site doesn’t have a user-friendly interface and
            is confusing on where to begin. Our website with its clean, user
            friendly, and modern look is very clear and transparent on where the
            user should begin in their search. <br />AutomobileShare a website
            where individuals who own vehicles can list them on the website to
            allow others to hire it for a few hours or days to earn the car
            owners some extra money. With the current trend in IT where access
            to all online listings can be found in one destination is what
            Honest Green Lion is aiming to get.

              are working on. We have not yet hosted a site on GitHub Pages as
              it is not yet ready.</i

          <h3>Roles</h3>
          <p>
            There are many roles that need to be assigned in order to get a
            proper website out there, like website developer, marketing
            strategist, UX designer, lead developer, lead designer, you name it!
            (Wahhab 2016 & Diffily 2013). However, while working on our project,
            Honest Green Lion did not really assign any specific roles. All the
            members did what they felt most comfortable with doing. Ayesha was
            assigned the task of designing the website, which she accomplished
            using Adobe XD. Matthew has worked on presenting our idea to
            potential employers/ venture capitalists, and the rest of the
            members worked on the deliverables for A3 and A5. HGL has yet, not
            found the time to begin working on the development of the actual
            website, however, we do plan to work on it, so hopefully soon
            enough, we will have something up and running!

          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p>
            In order to test our project, we will first interview potential
            users, even before starting with the project, so that we can have a
            rough idea about what the users are expecting from us and what their
            goals are. A quick findings report will be made to summarise all the
            information found from the interviews and a prototype will be made
            accordingly (Nielson 2005). Once the prototype is ready, usability
            testing will be conducted. Usability testing is very important as it
            saves development money and time, and raises the possibility of
            success (Praxent 2019). Once the potential users have identified
            their frustrations, we will re-design the website. This process will
            be repeated until we come up with the best possible solution. This
            way, we can make sure that the chances of our website succeeding is
            high.<br />
