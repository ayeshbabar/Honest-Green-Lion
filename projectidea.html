              is a link to the public GitHub Repository of the project that we
              are working on. We have not yet hosted a site on GitHub Pages as
              it is not yet ready.</i

          <h3>Roles</h3>
          <p>
            There are many roles that need to be assigned in order to get a
            proper website out there, like website developer, marketing
            strategist, UX designer, lead developer, lead designer, you name it!
            (Wahhab 2016 & Diffily 2013). However, while working on our project,
            Honest Green Lion did not really assign any specific roles. All the
            members did what they felt most comfortable with doing. Ayesha was
            assigned the task of designing the website, which she accomplished
            using Adobe XD. Matthew has worked on presenting our idea to
            potential employers/ venture capitalists, and the rest of the
            members worked on the deliverables for A3 and A5. HGL has yet, not
            found the time to begin working on the development of the actual
            website, however, we do plan to work on it, so hopefully soon
            enough, we will have something up and running!
          </p>

          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>Upcoming...</p>
          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p>
            In order to test our project, we will first interview potential
            users, even before starting with the project, so that we can have a
            rough idea about what the users are expecting from us and what their
            goals are. A quick findings report will be made to summarise all the
            information found from the interviews and a prototype will be made
            accordingly (Nielson 2005). Once the prototype is ready, usability
            testing will be conducted. Usability testing is very important as it
            saves development money and time, and raises the possibility of
            success (Praxent 2019). Once the potential users have identified
            their frustrations, we will re-design the website. This process will
            be repeated until we come up with the best possible solution. This
            way, we can make sure that the chances of our website succeeding is
            high.<br />
