          <h3>Topic</h3>
          <p>
            AutomobileShare is the project idea of Honest Green Lion.
            AutomobileShare is a web-based service that allows car owners to
            list their vehicles with availability for individuals to hire from a
            few hours to days or weeks. Individuals can search for car brands,
            availability and location. This is intended to give individuals an
            efficient experience. There are countless websites from car rentals
            to share rides such as Kayak, and Autorentals.com, etc (Perkins
            2021), however Honest Green Lion looked at this idea and thought why
            not allow people to make money off their own vehicles. Users will be
            able to choose a location to pick up the vehicle, have a timeframe
            the vehicle is available, and set prices depending on what time of
            the day it is or what day of the week. AutomobileShare is a
            different concept to the traditional rental of a car. Members of
            this service have total control over every aspect of this
            service.<br />
            Members will be able to sign up to this service via a website or
            mobile app. Members will need to provide personal data such as Name,
            Date of Birth, licence type, state of Issue, any state, territory or
            federal convictions (such as drink driving, loss of licence
            offences) (FTC.gov 2012). This data will then be vetted to confirm
            the member is suitable for this service at this current time. Users
            of this service will also need to bear in mind if they are involved
            in an accident an excess of the members vehicle will need to be
            paid, this will ensure the members who offer their car to this
            service aren't out of pocket and users cannot treat this service as
            a free for all.
          </p>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            Could your car make you money? Does your vehicle just sit in the
            garage? Do you worry about upcoming expenses for your vehicle? What
            if there was a way you could make your vehicle work for you.
            AutomobileShare may be the answer to your problems. AutomobileShare
            is a car sharing platform that will allow you to lease out your
            vehicle when it is not in use. Think of Airbnb but for vehicles. You
            will be able to set dates for your vehicle’s availability, set
            prices, set age limits and even approve or disapprove users from
            your vehicle. You will be 100% in control.
          </p>
          <h3>Landscape</h3>
          <p>
            A quick internet search for “Car for hire” you will come across
            multiple websites that have outdated and complicated user
            interferences and experiences. For example, carjet.com with its
            messy interference, asks the users to complete multiple actions in
            one given time. This site doesn’t have a user-friendly interface and
            is confusing on where to begin. Our website with its clean, user
            friendly, and modern look is very clear and transparent on where the
            user should begin in their search. <br />AutomobileShare a website
            where individuals who own vehicles can list them on the website to
            allow others to hire it for a few hours or days to earn the car
            owners some extra money. With the current trend in IT where access
            to all online listings can be found in one destination is what
            Honest Green Lion is aiming to get.
          </p>
          <h3>Aims</h3>
          <p>
            The current aim for Honest Green Lion’s project, would be to
            “Complete the AutomobileShare Website Homepage by 20/2/2021”. This
            aim means that Honest Green Lion need to complete their
            AutomobileShare Website, by the end of Week 12. The AutomobileShare
            Website is one of the first steps, this will give the
            AutomobileShare users access to the service and give guidance to
            members wishing to use this service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Goal 1 (Contribution/Time Management):</u> The first goal of
            completing this aim “Complete the AutomobileShare Website Homepage
            by 20/2/2021” would be for all the Honest Green Lion group members
            to take in some time to be able to work on this site. If all the
            Honest Green Lion group members – work on the Homepage for at least
            half an hour every day, the website could easily be finished within
            the Aim deadline (20/2/2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Goal 2 (No conflicts):</u> The second goal of completing this aim
            “Complete the AutomobileShare Website Homepage by 20/2/2021” would
            be for all the Honest Green Lion group members to avoid minuscule
            conflicts IE. amount of Contribution needed. If conflicts are
            avoided – there will be less arguing within the group and less time
            will be wasted (meaning that there will be more time for
            contribution – and therefore completing the aim) However some
            conflicts cannot be avoided if they do arise members are encouraged
            to talk about the issue to help resolve it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Goal 3 (Assist each other):</u> The third and final goal of
            completing this aim “Complete the AutomobileShare Website Homepage
            by 20/2/2021” would be for all the Honest Green Members to assist
            each other with problems such as (Not able to understand a concept
            needed to be learnt or If others are not able to contribute). If all
            the members assist each other instead of sitting on tasks wondering
            how to start, there may be a faster turn around and more time
            completing other important aims.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Overview:</u> The current and main aim for this project is “To
            complete the AutomobileShare Website Homepage by 20/2/2021”. The
            goals that were set to complete this aim was for:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              All members to contribute (members must work on their tasks for
              the aim for at least half an hour a day – to be able to complete
              this goal by the aim deadline “20/2/2021”).
            </li>
            <li>
              No conflicts between each other (members must not have conflicts
              with each other – to be able to complete this aim by/before the
              deadline).
            </li>
            <li>
              All members must assist each other (If all the Honest Green Lion
              group members were able to assist each other with some of their
              tasks – the quicker the time that is taken for completing the
              current aim. Then there will be more time on completing other
              important aims).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The most important goal out of all 3 goals would be goal 1 (All
            members must contribute). All the group members must contribute to
            be able to finish the goal – if no one contributed the aim would not
            be completed, and the project building process will be delayed or
            even stop. If the members of Honest Green Lion did not achieve the
            other goals – that would not have such an impact on the
            AutomobileShare Website (the other 2 goals work in conjunction in
            completing goal 1).
          </p>
          <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
          <p>
            In Assignment two, Honest Green Lion have decided for our IT project
            to be a car rental service that is different to traditional rental
            car companies or ride share, it is called AutomobileShare (Bolotyukh
            2020). This is different to other similar car hire or leasing
            companies as AutomobileShare allows users to sign up at the
            AutomobileShare website which has a clean and user-friendly
            interface with high signal-to-noise ratio (Bradley 2010). Users can
            determine all aspects of their hiring period, such as allowing users
            to make money off their own personal vehicles, users can also select
            their pickup locations, set the time frames as to when the vehicle
            will be available, and can set the costs for hiring during different
            days of the week or based on the time frame desired and possibly the
            number of kilometers driven. Users of AutomobileShare will have to
            remember that if they are involved in an accident that they will
            need to pay an excess amount that is deemed suitable to the owner of
            the vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            For consumers to use AutomobileShare they must provide their general
            information such as name, date of birth (DOB), Address, License
            details; license type or class, license number, state, or territory
            of issue, expiry dates, any criminal records or convictions held,
            such as loss of license, disqualification, previous vehicle
            accidents, driving history checks or drunk or drug driving (Rent My
            Car 2021). This information will then be used to determine whether
            the user is suitable to use AutomobileShare. Upon sign up to
            AutomobileShare users will be notified that if they currently hold a
            probationary license, that they will be restricted to certain types
            of vehicles that are not high powered (like vehicles with a V8
            engine) or any modified performance vehicles (like vehicles with
            supercharge). (More cars to choose from for P plate drivers, 2021).
            Those users who currently hold a learner’s driver license will be
            notified that they are unable to use and sign up AutomobileShare
            until they obtain their probationary license.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vehicle owners will be able to set the costs for the hire of their
            vehicle based on what they believe is reasonable. The vehicle must
            have a full tank of fuel prior to being leased and must also be
            returned at the end of the lease with a full tank of fuel (Do I Need
            to Fill the Car with Petrol Before I Return It?, 2021). It is the
            vehicle owner’s responsibility to notify the person booking the car
            of the type of fuel required for their vehicle. Before any keys are
            passed over to the leaser, both the leaser and the vehicle owner
            will have to agree to the costs involved, they may be able to
            negotiate the prices for longer hire periods, which is at the
            discretion of the vehicle owner. The owner must also advise the
            users of any access costs that they will incur if any damage has
            been made to their vehicle. A lease agreement stating the exact hire
            details along with the cost involved must be signed by both parties
            prior to keys being handed over (The Difference Between a Lease and
            a Rental Agreement, 2021). At completion of the agreement all funds
            required will be pre-approved, to ensure that the funds are
            available. Once the hire period has ended and the keys are returned
            to the owner, the owner must then check the vehicle, to see if any
            damage has been made, the fees will then be processed and deposited
            into the nominated bank account.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a requirement for all members of AutomobileShare who wish to
            share their vehicle must provide evidence of recent full-service
            history of the vehicle along with a copy of registration details; to
            ensure that the vehicle is roadworthy and registered prior to the
            vehicle being available to consumers for hire (Opening a Car Hire
            Company: Top 3 Legal Issues| LegalVision, 2021). Along with these
            above-mentioned requirements and for vehicle owners and consumers
            peace of mind and to ensure the safety of all members all vehicles
            must also have full comprehensive insurance. Vehicles can be fitted
            with GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking devices attached to
            them so along with AutomobileShare the owners of the vehicle will be
            able to always see the location of their vehicle (When you rent a
            car, does the company secretly track you?, 2021). Owners of the
            vehicles may choose to pass on some of the costs of, vehicle
            maintenance, GPS tracking devices, full comprehensive insurance,
            registration etc. to the users.
          </p>
          <p>
            If members of AutomobileShare have not been accurate or honest with
            their vehicle details or requirements, such as stating that their
            vehicle has full comprehensive insurance, or recent full service or
            GPS tracking than they will be held accountable for any issues that
            may arise and AutomobileShare will not be held responsible or
            accountable for this. Upon sign up of members to the AutomobileShare
            website or App, a legal document stating these terms and conditions
            must be signed prior to any hiring agreements of the vehicle taking
            place (Insurance Law Service, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            All users must abide by all road rules and regulations throughout
            their hiring period. If any illegal behavior is undertaken by the
            leaser during this time, they may be required to forfeit the vehicle
            and be banned from using AutomobileShare services again. They will
            also be held accountable to pay for any fines, or infringement
            notices that they may have incurred during their hire period (10
            Things Not to Do When Renting a Car, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            AutomobileShare members will have the ability to have contactless
            pick-up and drop off services available for their vehicles via
            setting allocated locations with the vehicles key being kept in
            lockers. Once suitable users have been determined after all their
            personal information has been verified, they will then be notified
            of the location they can pick up the key for their selected vehicle
            or the location and time they can meet with the owner to pick up the
            key (Ultimate Guide to Renting a Car for the First Time | AutoSlash,
            2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the vehicle leaser has finished their desired hiring period,
            they will be prompted to review their experiences, give feedback,
            and rate the services from AutomobileShare. Once this is completed
            as an incentive for uses to come back and use AutomobileShare again
            they may receive a discount that would expire within a certain time
            frame to use on another rental agreement (How rental car companies
            reach high customer satisfaction, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            To make sure that our project is successful once it is launched, we
            will conduct some usability testing (Praxent 2019). This will be
            done by completing wire-framing and interactive prototyping for the
            website, AutomobileShare, and finding potential users, and
            conducting interviews. Users that book/ rent cars online were
            considered as potential users for our website. We conducted
            interviews and usability testing from five potential users, and the
            design solution was patched up accordingly. We have begun working on
            the website. Some HTML, CSS, JavaScript code has been written for
            the home page. The development of the website is still under
            progress, so we have not yet hosted our site on GitHub pages.<br />Honest
            Green Lion has given a lot of thought into what sort of skills they
            will require in order get this website up and running. We have come
            up with some positions that we will need to hire as we currently
            lack some skills. We have determined the users’ goals and set our
            aims accordingly. Scope and limits, tools and technologies,
            timeframe, and the risks involved have all been thoroughly explored.

              is a link to the public GitHub Repository of the project that we
              are working on. We have not yet hosted a site on GitHub Pages as
              it is not yet ready.</i
            >
          </p>
          <h3>Roles</h3>
          <p>
            There are many roles that need to be assigned in order to get a
            proper website out there, like website developer, marketing
            strategist, UX designer, lead developer, lead designer, you name it!
            (Wahhab 2016 & Diffily 2013). However, while working on our project,
            Honest Green Lion did not really assign any specific roles. All the
            members did what they felt most comfortable with doing. Ayesha was
            assigned the task of designing the website, which she accomplished
            using Adobe XD. Matthew has worked on presenting our idea to
            potential employers/ venture capitalists, and all the members,
            together worked on writing up some code for the development of the
            website.
          </p>
          <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
          <p>
            Some of our scope and limits for AutomobileShare was that the User
            Interface and User Experience was to be produced first and the
            backend of our website could not be done for multiple reasons, one
            was that we did not have enough time to produce an ideal front end
            and add a database, security and so forth. We agreed upon the fact
            that users do not see the backend so it was best to produce first
            what is dear to the user. We finished and completed what was planned
            in our group meetings. We produced a nice and user-friendly website
            prototype.
          </p>
          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            One of the software that is required for this project would be web
            app: GitHub
            <a href="https://www.github.com">(https://www.github.com)</a> or
            desktop app: GitHub desktop Version 2.6.2 or higher. GitHub was
            needed to host and edit our project website (AutomobileShare). Once
            the contribution and collaboration the website has finished being
            created, GitHub pages can be deployed. GitHub pages allows the
            AutomobileShare HTML website file to be published within GitHub
            itself.<br />All members of the group have a beginner experience
            with both GitHub and GitHub desktop, as these programs were needed
            to be used for Assignment 1 (for making the website about
            themselves) and Assignment 2 (for creating and team website “Honest
            Green Lion”). (GitHub: Where the world builds software, 2021).<br />Another
            tool that was used for the design process of this website is Adobe
            XD. Adobe is a designing tool used by professional designers to
            design the User Interface and Experience (Valishvili 2019).<br />Although
            the making of the project is still under progress, so we haven’t
            used much tools yet, we have considered the tools we will require in
            order to keep working on it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We will need an up to date editor, such as VS Code, or PHP Storm,
              etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              For back end development we will need something like Express.js or
              Laravel (Clark 2020).
            </li>
            <li>
              Some other options include Adobe Flash, for image editing (Craig
              2009).
            </li>
            <li>
              We’ll require something like WYSIWYG (what you see is what you
              get) programs such as Adobe DreamWeaver, etc (Bethea 2021).
            </li>
            <li>Content Management Systems (Bethea 2021).</li>
            <li>
              FTP (file transfer protocol) tools such as File Zilla (Bolton
              2021).
            </li>
            <li>An analytics tool like Google Analytics (Bolton 2021).</li>
            <li>And last, but not least, Browsers (Bolton 2021).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We acknowledge that these are not the only tools that we will
            require. We might need more than just these and we might even need
            to use some of these. However, we will make sure to research
            properly before beginning to use a tool, should we feel the need to
            do so.
          </p>
          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p>
            In order to test our project, we will first interview potential
            users, even before starting with the project, so that we can have a
            rough idea about what the users are expecting from us and what their
            goals are. A quick findings report will be made to summarise all the
            information found from the interviews and a prototype will be made
            accordingly (Nielson 2005). Once the prototype is ready, usability
            testing will be conducted. Usability testing is very important as it
            saves development money and time, and raises the possibility of
            success (Praxent 2019). Once the potential users have identified
            their frustrations, we will re-design the website. This process will
            be repeated until we come up with the best possible solution. This
            way, we can make sure that the chances of our website succeeding is
            high.<br />

          <h3>Risks</h3>
          <p>For our project, we found there to be three major risks. One risk to take into consideration are the tools that we have assigned necessary for future use. Not all members of the group have had experience with IT before and therefore most of these tools are relatively new to them. At this stage there is no way of knowing how much difficulty each member will have learning the software. Another risk is using the limited time allocated to develop such an extensive application. Many components of the application were easy to construct but as we further prepare our project for presentation to the stakeholders, perfecting certain components take time we do not have. According to Barrow (2018) ‘applications can take anywhere between three and nine months to develop’. However, we only had 15 weeks to finalise everything. The final risk recognised for this project was only focusing on a single platform for our application. There are many advantages to this such as cost efficiency (Perera n.d). However, developing the app for use in only a web browser means that accessing the website on a handheld device, such as a mobile phone, may exhibit varying results such as the display not being as flawless as on a computer (Perera n.d). People want to access a user-friendly application on mobile when a laptop is inaccessible and if there are problems with the website may choose to download an alternate app instead. </p>
          <h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>
          <p>
            Group Processes and Communications at Honest Green Lion was all
            conducted Online. Our Group meetings were all held on Microsoft
            Teams and our discussions were also held on Microsoft Teams.
            Microsoft Teams provided multiple useful features such as an open
            real time file editing system where multiple Users can work on a
            single file at the same time without the need to re-upload the same
            file multiple times. During our group meetings we used Microsoft
            Storyboard that allowed us to draw and sketch our ideas in front at
            real time together as a team.
            <br />
            Microsoft Teams allowed us to add third party integration to our
            team to make the process of producing the work more efficient for
            us. At first, we planned to use Trello, (“Trello helps teams work
            more collaboratively and get more done. Trello’s boards, lists, and
            cards enable teams to organize and prioritize projects in a fun,
            flexible, and rewarding way” (Trello.com).), though our team never
            ended up working with Trello due to the complicated logging in
            process.
