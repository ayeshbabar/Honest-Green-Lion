							<p>Could your car make you money? Does your vehicle just sit in the garage? Do you worry about upcoming expenses for your vehicle? What if there was a way you could make your vehicle work for you. AutomobileShare may be the answer to your problems. AutomobileShare is car sharing platform that will allow you to lease out your vehicle when it is not in use. Think of Airbnb but for vehicles. You will be able to set dates for your vehicle’s availably, set prices, set age limits even approve or disapprove users from your vehicle. You will be 100% in control.</p>
							<p>There are countless websites from car rentals to share rides. However Honest Green Lion looked at this idea and thought why not allow people to make money off their own vehicles. Users will be able to choose a location to pick up the vehicle, have a timeframe the vehicle is available and set prices depending on what time of the day it is or what day of the week. AutomobileShare is a different concept to the traditional rental of a car. Members of this service have total control over every aspect of this service. Members will be able to sign up to this service via a website or mobile app. Members will need to provide personal data such as Name, Date of Birth, licence type, state of Issue, any state, territory or federal convictions (such as drink driving, loss of licence offences). This data will then be vetted to confirm the member is suitable for this service at this current time. Users of this service will also need to bear in mind if they are involved in an accident an excess of the members vehicle will need to be paid, this will ensure the members who offers their car to this service isn’t out of pocket and users cannot treat this service as a free for all.  </p>
							<p> Once members sign up, vetting of the user is conducted by confirming members have a valid driver's licence for each state or territory they reside in. Depending on the type of licence such as probationary, or learners the member will be advise if they can use this service. If a probationary driver signs up, these drivers will only have access to vehicles outlined in the Government regulations to what is suitable for that licence type. Probationary will not have access to high powered cars or performance cars. If learner drivers do sign up, they will be advised this service is not available and will need to sign up when their licence becomes valid. Members who wish to share their vehicle will need to undergo a full service and roadworthy check before any vehicle enters the service. A minimum age of the vehicle will be set to 15 years old or newer. This is to guarantee there is a level of safety for the members. Members who opt in will need to make sure their vehicle is insured to a full comprehensive standard and the vehicle fully registered. GPS tracking can be optional standard on all vehicles, this will ensure peace of mind for both parties involved as it will provide tracking of the vehicle and owners will be able to see where their vehicle is at any time. It will also provide safety to the user with in the car to adhere to speed limits and abide to the road rules. There can also be a speaker to advise the user to slow down, or advise them they have entered a school zone or a lower speed zone. Members can set aside key locations to their vehicle. Once the members have approved the user to drive their car, the location is given. This maybe just a padlock with the key inside, holding box or even from the member them-self. A rating system will also be implemented to give users a discount if their rating and service has been well received. This can be an incentive for users to use this system as the next time they use it, there may a discount applied to the final price. Vehicle owners will be able to set their own price on what they think is a fair and reasonable cost. Depending on duration of days to hours to even a couple of kilometers, all prices will be organised and accepted by both parties before keys are exchanged. This will give both members and users assurance of a set and fair price. At the time of agreement, the owner of the vehicle will advise the user of the excess cost if any damage to the vehicle has been done. Funds will be pre-approved at the completion of the agreement, giving assurance to the vehicle owner that funds are available. Upon completion of the AutomobileShare the owner is to check the vehicle for any damage and once complete funds will be exchanged to the nominated bank account. </p>
							<p> The user interface will be the main selling point of this service. Clean, reliable, and fast website with members having access to all information relating to their service. This in turn can be made into a mobile app as well as a mobile web version. Part of the user experience would be feedback, providing members with a Star rating and provide discounts after members have held consecutive positive ratings. Members current and past driving history would need an integration into state and territory vehicle government databases. This is to confirm members have a current and non-suspended license as well confirming members do not hold a current conviction. GPS navigation would be most challenging part of this system. Members would need to place a GPS tracker for Vehicles such as the ‘Trak-4’ (Trak4 – GPS Tracker and Location Monitoring, 2021) into their vehicles. This technology will then allow the members to be able to track their vehicle through the AutomobileShare website or mobile app. Although this service, if Trak-4 is chosen, will need a subscription this service. When members sign up minor charges may be involved to cover costs of AutomobileShare services. All fees and services will be upfront with members so there will be no surprises. Members can opt out of options such as GPS, or Insurance but if members do, there will be no support from AutomobileShare if anything does arise. </p>
							<p> A dedicated web developer will be needed, with minimum qualifications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL. This member’s primary role would be building and overseeing web development and deployment. A mobile app developer for iOS and Android would integrate with the web developer to make a seamless mobile experience. A network engineer primarily GPS specialist would be involved providing GPS feeds of the individual members vehicle. Integration into the website would be a necessity. </p>
							<p> Honest Green Lion are confident a prototype website would be available within the coming months. All members of Honest Green Lion have spent countless nights brainstorming and coming up with the best possible course of action for this website to be achievable. GPS tracking is a possibility however it has been noted that the timeframe may be pushed out due to countless tests that would have to be made. Reliable data delivered fast is a strong creed Honest Green Lion have come to adapt and do not want to rush this technology if it deemed to be unreliable or faulty. sAnother foreseeable setback within AutomobileShare Honest Green Lion have come to terms with would be the access of Government data. One example of this was after researching ‘VicRoads’ (How to make a request for VicRoads data, 2021) requesting data takes time and may not integrate as planned. Once data can be obtained, inputting and formatting of the text may be difficult. This is an unknown at this stage as no data been requested and VicRoads export format is also unknown. Whilst this data may be available, Honest Green Lion needs to respect members privacy and abide by the Privacy and Data Protection Act of 2014 (Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014, 2021). As the example just given was for the state of Victoria, each state and territory would have to undergo the same research and consolidate all the data formats for AutomobileShare to work flawlessly. </p>
