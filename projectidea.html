            is a link to the public GitHub Repository of the project that we are
            working on. We have not yet hosted a site on GitHub Pages as it is
            not yet ready. <br />

          <h3>Roles</h3>
          <p>
            There are many roles that need to be assigned in order to get a
            proper website out there, like website developer, marketing
            strategist, UX designer, lead developer, lead designer, you name it!
            (Wahhab 2016 & Diffily 2013). However, while working on our project,
            Honest Green Lion did not really assign any specific roles. All the
            members did what they felt most comfortable with doing. Ayesha was
            assigned the task of designing the website, which she accomplished
            using Adobe XD. Matthew has worked on presenting our idea to
            potential employers/ venture capitalists, and the rest of the
            members worked on the deliverables for A3 and A5. HGL has yet, not
            found the time to begin working on the development of the actual
            website, however, we do plan to work on it, so hopefully soon
            enough, we will have something up and running!
